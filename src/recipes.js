Season the chicken thighs with 2 teaspoons of the salt and 1 teaspoon of the black pepper. Place on a rimmed baking sheet, skin side up, and roast for 20 minutes, or until the skin is lightly browned. Remove from the oven and set aside. Don’t throw that fat away, it’s going in the gumbo later.', 'In a heavy Dutch oven over medium heat, make a dark roux by simmering the oil and flour for about 45 minutes. Once the roux is the color of milk chocolate, add the trinity of onion, bell pepper, and celery and stir once every 5 seconds for about a minute until the vegetables begin to soften and caramelize. The roux is rocking hot, so these vegetables are going to cook really quickly. Don’t walk away! After a minute, add the garlic and bay leaves and cook for another 30 seconds, stirring frequently.', 'Deglaze the pot with the beer, scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon until all the browned bits are released. Stir constantly until it returns to a simmer. Add the stock and continue stirring until it returns to a simmer. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper and the cayenne. Add the reserved chicken thighs (skin, bones, everything) and their fat and the sausage. Bring back to a bare simmer, being careful not to let it boil and not to let the roux scorch, reduce the heat to the lowest setting on your stove, and cover. Simmer for 3 hours, stirring every 30 minutes, scraping the bottom each time. Your gumbo should begin to thicken, but not like gravy. If it starts getting too thick before the 3 hours are up and you have to hit it with a little water to thin it, do so.', 'Do not skim that fat off the top!!!!', 'Serve with rice. Garnish with sliced green onions. If you want to bump up the heat, add a little scoop of pepper paste'],

(No need for a mixer, you can beat by hand using a wooden spoon.)', 'Spread the chopped pecans over the bottom of a frozen pie shell. Pour the filling over the pecans. Don\'t worry about burying the pecans, they will rise to the surface. (If you have reserved a few whole pecan halves, you can arrange them on the surface in a decorative pattern. Just dip them below the wet filling and let them rise again so they get coated with the filling.)', 'Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes tent the pie loosely with aluminum foil to prevent the crust and pecans from getting too browned. Bake for another 35 to 45 minutes until the filling has set.

Make sure you wrap the roll as tightly as possible.', 'Once you reach the starting point, run the twine under some of the end wraps; this hooks the twine in place so you can reverse direction. Next, run the twine under 4 or 5 wraps going away from the starting point. Then, double back toward the starting point, running your twine under the wraps until you reach the original double knot.', 'Find the 3-inch tail of twine that you left when you started. Tie a double knot with the tail and the long end of the twine, and cut the excess.', 'Heat the oil in a cast-iron skillet (or regular frying pan) over high heat. Add the tied pork belly to the skillet.', 'Sear the pork belly one side at a time, rotating it to make sure all sides are golden brown.', 'Transfer the seared chashu to the Dutch oven with all liquids and ingredients for sauce', 'Simmer on low heat, and cover with the otoshibuta at all times for the next 2 hours, turning the chashu every 30 minutes.

Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form.', 'Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it\'s TOO sticky (meaning it\'s sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface.', 'Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel.

You should get 9 large pieces.', 'Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or round 9 inch cake pan.

Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30-45 minutes.', 'Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges.
